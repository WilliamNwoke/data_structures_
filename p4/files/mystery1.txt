Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room. There he saw nobody,
but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of
unwashed crocks in the kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. The
washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not
been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he was really relieved after all to think
that they had all gone without him, and without bothering to wake him up (“but with never a thank-
you” he thought); and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling
surprised him.
